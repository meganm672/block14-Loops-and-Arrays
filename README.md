##Only Odds
Create a JavaScript code that accepts an array of numbers and returns a new array with only the odd numbers from the original array. If there is only one odd number in the array, return an array with that single value.



##Vowel versus Consonant
Create a JavaScript code that accepts a string of lowercase letters. Print the word followed by how many consonants and vowels it has.

"a", "e", "i", "o", and "u" are considered vowels. 

Every other letter is considered a consonant.

Hint: Define two variables that keep track of the number of consonants and vowels.



##Reverse Array
With a for loop, create a JavaScript code that creates a new array in reverse order.

##FizzBuzz
Create a JavaScript code that prints each number from 1 to 100 on a new line.

For each multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.

For each multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.

For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.
